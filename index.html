            <li><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10078584" target="_blank">Energy Theft Detection Using the Wasserstein Distance on Residuals </a></li>
            <p>  The conference article published in the IEEE Texas Power and Energy Conference (TPEC), introduces a novel framework for detecting electricity theft. It uses an LSTM neural network for forecasting daily energy consumption and the Wasserstein distance for identifying anomalies indicative of theft. The proposed method is highly explainable, efficient, and demonstrated impressive performance in detecting energy theft with a 9% false positive rate and an average F1 score of 0.91. </p>

            <li><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9384823" target="_blank">A novel design of a locomotion system for Active capsule endoscopy </a></li>
            <p> The conference article published in the International Conference on Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering (ICMRE), presents a novel design of an active endoscopy system. The system, controlled by an endoscopist, uses a unique locomotor with shape-memory alloy (SMA) actuators in a hinge mechanism. This design allows for precise capsule motion control in the GI tract, camera steering for a wider view angle, and efficient power consumption, all without increasing the capsule's size or weight. The prototype is created using 3D printing technology. </p>

            <li><a> under-review: How Effective are Synthetic Attack Models to Detect Real-World Energy Theft? </a></li>
            <p> The article is currently under-review in the IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid and it critically evaluates the efficacy of synthetic attack models used in Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) security. It assesses how well these models can simulate real-world electricity theft and their performance correlation. The research reveals significant performance deterioration when these models are applied to real-world scenarios and suggests a subset of synthetic attacks that could effectively represent the full set of attacks. </p>

            <li><a> under-review: Smart Grid Public Datasets: Characteristics And Associated Applications </a></li>
            <p> This under-review paper in the IEEE Internet of Things Journal provides a thorough analysis of over 50 public datasets relevant to energy management, encompassing consumer data, building data, and grid data. It highlights the datasets' various applications, including IoT solutions, and aids researchers in selecting appropriate datasets for their work. By identifying existing gaps and challenges, the paper aims to foster innovation in energy management and IoT applications, supporting the development of a sustainable and resilient future energy infrastructure. </p>

            <p>This review provides a comprehensive examination of privacy concerns in the field of machine learning, with a focus on federated learning and differential privacy. It discusses the increasing need for privacy-preserving methods in machine learning due to challenges such as data collection and usage, computational resources, and the risk of inference attacks. The authors review and compare various existing privacy-preserving techniques, highlight their limitations, and suggest future research directions. The paper makes a distinct contribution by offering a broad analysis of all privacy-preserving techniques in machine learning, rather than focusing on a single aspect or method.</p>

            <p>The review explores various models and methods for preserving privacy in data publishing, addressing identity, membership, and attribute disclosure threats. It examines models like k-anonymity, l-diversity, and d-presence, highlighting the balance between data utility and privacy. It also scrutinizes four anonymization approaches for different types of data - transaction datasets, time-series data, multi-attribute data, and set-valued data - each using unique algorithms to maintain privacy while preserving data utility.</p>

            <p>The paper critically analyzes the current privacy-preserving techniques used in the Internet of Medical Things with Federated Learning, pointing out several limitations such as insufficient privacy evaluations, lack of clear explanations, and inadequacy in non-iid data scenarios. The paper proposes a novel method to improve data utility and privacy in Federated Learning, which involves training local models, sharing only labels of certain samples, and using a differentially private context space. This approach aims to enhance prediction accuracy and relevance while protecting user privacy, offering potential benefits like improved utility, reduced information exposure, and adaptability in various Federated Learning settings.</p>

            <p> The article presents PP-T, a novel approach for private publishing of time-series data in smart grids. It aims to balance the trade-off between data utility and user privacy. By ensuring each data query returns a minimum of K consumers and implementing a unique data schema to protect individual readings, PP-T effectively maintains user privacy without compromising the utility of the data for tasks like consumer clustering and consumption forecasting.</p>

            <p> The research project explores the use of long-short-term Memory (LSTM) networks for predicting workload in cloud computing environments. The goal is to proactively manage computing resources in response to fluctuating user demand. Timely resource provisioning or shutting down based on forecasted workload can lead to significant efficiency improvements and cost savings, while enhancing the quality of service provided to the users. A comparative simulation demonstrating the impact of using predicted versus actual workloads for resource allocation is also presented in the study.</p>
